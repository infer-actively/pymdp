    """
    Update marginal posterior beliefs about hidden states
    using a new version of variational fixed point iteration (FPI). 
    @NOTE (Conor, 26.02.2020):
    This method uses a faster algorithm than the traditional 'spm_dot' approach. Instead of
    separately computing a conditional joint log likelihood of an outcome, under the
    posterior probabilities of a certain marginal, instead all marginals are multiplied into one 
    joint tensor that gives the joint likelihood of an observation under all hidden states, 
    that is then sequentially (and *parallelizably*) marginalized out to get each marginal posterior. 
    This method is less RAM-intensive, admits heavy parallelization, and runs (about 2x) faster.
    @NOTE (Conor, 28.02.2020):
    After further testing, discovered interesting differences between this version and the 
    original version. It appears that the
    original version (simple 'run_vanilla_fpi') shows mean-field biases or 'explaining away' 
    effects, whereas this version spreads probabilities more 'fairly' among possibilities.
    To summarize: it actually matters what order you do the summing across the joint likelihood tensor. 
    In this verison, all marginals are multiplied into the likelihood tensor before summing out, 
    whereas in the previous version, marginals are recursively multiplied and summed out.
    @NOTE (Conor, 24.04.2020): I would expect that the factor_order approach used above would help 
    ameliorate the effects of the mean-field bias. I would also expect that the use of a factor_order 
    below is unnnecessary, since the marginalisation w.r.t. each factor is done only after all marginals 
    are multiplied into the larger tensor.
